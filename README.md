# NFSU Unlimiter
NFSU Unlimiter is a script mod which fixes some issues for added cars.

This is an early version of it and it has lots of things to do:
- Add UnlimiterData configurations for each car, so the modders can configure if the cars can be used by AI opponents.
- Fix the car select screen to make it show more than 20 racing cars at the same time.
etc.
